## Description
This repository is the implementation of some typical cases in the book *[HeadFirstDesignPatterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/)* using C++.

And this C++ implementation refers to the JAVA code of the original book, which is available [here](https://wickedsmart.com/head-first-design-patterns).

If you need notes for review, I also wrote a concise article for this book, which was posted on [my blog](https://suikasan111.github.io/2024/02/07/%E3%80%8AHead-First%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F%E3%80%8B%E7%B2%BE%E7%82%BC%E6%95%B4%E7%90%86/).
